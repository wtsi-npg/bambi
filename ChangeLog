	new seqchksum function
	use htslib hopen() to enable bambi use with S3, AWS, et al
	check_bcl utility added
	adapter check function added (detect and mark with auxtags, clipping coming soon)

	i2b function updated to handle NovaSeq SP flowcell (single surface)


	[0.11.2]
	integer overflow bug in spatial_filter fixed

	[0.11.1]
	posix_fadvise() on NovaSeq cbcl files to pre-cache the next tile to speed up reads
	bug fix: removeBadTiles() was not being honored in spatial_filter application

	[0.11.0]
	fixed divide-by-zero bug in tag hops report

	[0.9.10]
	Bug fix: decode memory leak fix

	[0.9.9]
	Bug fix: decode stats counts templates rather than reads

	Bug fix: remove old RG lines before adding new ones (decode)
	Handle separators in tag indexes

	[0.9.6]
	decode function refactored to work with read groups instead of individual read records

	Implemented 'bambi read2tags' for extracting sequence and quality ranges from reads and assigning them to auxiliary tags

	[0.9.4]
	Implemented 'bambi chrsplit' for SplitBamByChromosome
	Implemented 'bambi select' for alignment filtering
	Add option to concatenate indexes, optionally with a '-'

	[0.9.3]
	changes to metrics file output for backwards compatibility (tag#0: no tag name, and perfect_matches pf_perfect matches set to 0)
