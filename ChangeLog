	[0.12.0]
	multi-threading and optimisations added to decode function
	allow decode option to run in parallel with i2b

	new seqchksum function
	use htslib hopen() to enable bambi use with S3, AWS, et al
	check_bcl utility added
	adapter check function added (detect and mark with auxtags, clipping coming soon)
	--rg flag use deprecated but not illegal (functionality removed)
	i2b function updated to handle NovaSeq SP flowcell (single surface)


	[0.11.2]
	integer overflow bug in spatial_filter fixed

	[0.11.1]
	posix_fadvise() on NovaSeq cbcl files to pre-cache the next tile to speed up reads
	bug fix: removeBadTiles() was not being honored in spatial_filter application

	[0.11.0]
	fixed divide-by-zero bug in tag hops report
	decode copes with taglist files with empty columns
	spatial_filter supports multiple filter files applied by RG ID
	refactoring of threadpool code and other performance enhancements

	[0.10.1]
	tag hops metrics file - unneeded columns removed; always create this file if dual index is detected (will only contain header values)

	Dual index handling (including tag-hopping report) in decode
	i2b now has multithreading

	[0.9.12]
	Bug fix: removed overstringent assertion in select
	enhancement: i2b now handles NovaSeq data

	[0.9.11]

	[0.9.10]
	Bug fix: decode memory leak fix

	[0.9.9]
	Bug fix: decode stats counts templates rather than reads

	[0.9.8]

	[0.9.7]
	Bug fix: remove old RG lines before adding new ones (decode)
	Handle separators in tag indexes

	[0.9.6]
	decode function refactored to work with read groups instead of individual read records

	[0.9.5]
	Implemented 'bambi read2tags' for extracting sequence and quality ranges from reads and assigning them to auxiliary tags

	[0.9.4]
	Implemented 'bambi chrsplit' for SplitBamByChromosome
	Implemented 'bambi select' for alignment filtering
	Add option to concatenate indexes, optionally with a '-'

	[0.9.3]
	changes to metrics file output for backwards compatibility (tag#0: no tag name, and perfect_matches pf_perfect matches set to 0)

	[0.9.2]
	include merge tag function for dual indexes
	Bugfix: bam_aux_update_str()

	[0.9.1]
